# Automated Manga Tracker & Reminder

A serverless, mobile-first automation that tracks manga reading progress and sends reminder emails when new chapters are available.

This project uses **iOS Shortcuts as a lightweight UI**, **GitHub Actions as the backend**, and a **single JSON file as persistent storage** — no servers, no databases.

1. User runs an **iOS Shortcut**
2. Shortcut sends manga title + chapter to GitHub
3. GitHub Action runs `update.mjs`
4. `tracked.json` is updated and committed
5. Weekly cron checks MangaDex for new chapters
6. If you’re behind → email reminder is sent


I created this because I read a lotttt of manga/manhwa and throughout the years each time I catch up to something I end up never reading it again 
because I don't write it down anywhere so this combines my love for manga and software!
